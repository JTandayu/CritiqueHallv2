## The Design and Implementation of "Critique Hall": A Discussion Forum Web Application for Students

## 1. Project Context of Critique Hall

- The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic introduced countless problems globally.
In the Philippine context, President Rodrigo Duterte announced the implementation of
“community quarantine” within the National Capital Region (NCR) supposedly lasting
for a whole month, beginning on the 15th of March, 2020. Aligned with the country’s
efforts to mitigate the spread of the disease was to suspend face-to-face meetings within
schools, universities, and institutions alike, leaving them with no choice but to transition
into online learning. As of writing, a year and a half have already passed and the
ever-extending quarantine still has not been lifted due to the continuous and rising surge
of COVID-19 cases. As a result, this makes the Philippines the only country in Southeast
Asia that is still implementing home-based learning (Hernando-Malipot, 2021). This kind
of transition is a luxury not every student can afford.
Notwithstanding, those with the privilege of learning online also face numerous
challenges themselves. For the purpose of this project, the main problems that the
researchers are trying to alleviate concern the students’ academic lives and personal
development amid this pandemic. With that said, the researchers understand that
professors can only do so much. That is why Critique Hall, a discussion forum web
responsive and secure application, will be designed as a learning supplement focused on
students for gathering and giving critiques regarding each other’s works.

## 2. Objectives of Critique Hall

The general objective of the project is to determine and provide a solution for the
challenges brought about by online learning by designing and implementing Critique
Hall, a discussion forum web application mainly for students.
In order to achieve the general objective, the following specific objectives have to
be met:
- To successfully design Critique Hall with all features functioning and operating
- To successfully implement Critique Hall for pilot testing to iACADEMY college
students
- To meet the student needs with regards to their academic lives and personal
development as discussed earlier in subchapter 1.2 Purpose and Description
- To measure the project’s efficacy through a dedicated tab with fill-up forms for
feedback, reviews, and suggestions
